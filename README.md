Modules are discrete educational components of a programme which, when considered collectively, make up the required credit for students to complete each level of a programme.However, in Canvas, your Digital Learning Platform, the term ‘Modules’ has a different meaning   - it is used to describe where all of the learning resources are stored.    For this reason, students will see the term ‘Course’ used in Canvas instead, but it means the same as Module (above).   The coursework assignment for this module is an individual assignment worth 30% of the overall module mark.
